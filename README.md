## React-Cursor-Game
* Powered by React, JavaScript, and CSS
* React Hooks Practice: The game serves as a practical application of React Hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, and `useRef`).

* Dynamic Difficulty: The game includes a timer that increases the speed at which circles are generated, providing a progressively challenging experience.*
